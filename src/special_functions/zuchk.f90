  !***DESCRIPTION
  !
  !      Y ENTERS AS A SCALED QUANTITY WHOSE MAGNITUDE IS GREATER THAN
  !      EXP(-ALIM)=ASCLE=1.0E+3*D1MACH(1)/TOL. THE TEST IS MADE TO SEE
  !      IF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REAL OR IMAGINARY PART WOULD UNDERFLOW
  !      WHEN Y IS SCALED (BY TOL) TO ITS PROPER VALUE. Y IS ACCEPTED
  !      IF THE UNDERFLOW IS AT LEAST ONE PRECISION BELOW THE MAGNITUDE
  !      OF THE LARGEST COMPONENT; OTHERWISE THE PHASE ANGLE DOES NOT HAVE
  !      ABSOLUTE ACCURACY AND AN UNDERFLOW IS ASSUMED.
