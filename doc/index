lib	slatec/src
#  This library contains the main SLATEC Fortran source.
# 
#  There are five (5) machine specific subprograms (D1MACH,
#  I1MACH, R1MACH, FDUMP and XERHLT) in the source file.
#  These are described further in the next two paragraphs.
# 
#  Machine constants, such as word length and maximum
#  positive exponent, are supplied to routines in SLATEC
#  source via the functions D1MACH, I1MACH and R1MACH.  Make
#  sure that each machine type at your site returns the
#  correct values for these functions.  In most cases, this
#  only requires replacing a "C" with a blank in the first
#  column of several lines of each function.  The copies of
#  D1MACH, I1MACH and R1MACH included in the source have all
#  the machine specific constants commented out with a "C" in
#  column one.
# 
#  The standard error handler has two machine dependent
#  subroutines in it: FDUMP and XERHLT.  The routine XERHLT
#  is called via XERMSG when a fatal error is encountered and
#  must terminate the job.  The copy of XERHLT included in
#  this file contains a "STOP" and thus does stop execution.
#  However, in most circumstances, this normal exit is
#  unacceptable when an error has been detected and this
#  subroutine should be replaced at each site.  The routine
#  FDUMP is called via XERMSG when traceback information is
#  desired.  This routine should provide the traceback
#  information to appropriate output files.  The copy of
#  FDUMP included in the source does not produce traceback
#  information.  If this function is desired, it must be
#  implemented at each site.
# 
#  It is assumed that all ANSI-77 standard intrinsic
#  functions are vendor-supplied and, therefore, are not
#  included in the main SLATEC source.  In the event that
#  some of these subprograms are not resident on the system
#  (e.g. DINT on CDC), many are included in the subsid. (See
#  below.)     In some cases, the higher special
#  functions (e.g. error functions, Bessel functions)
#  anticipate that certain errors will be handled in the
#  intrinsic functions.  This may not be done appropriately
#  in vendor-supplied intrinsic functions and may cause
#  difficulties.

lib	slatec/linear
for	the BLAS, LINPACK, EISPACK, SLAP subset of SLATEC
# removed from slatec/src to make the main source more accessible
# see also /netlib/blas, /netlib/linpack, /netlib/eispack, /netlib/slap

lib	slatec/fishfft
for	the FISHPACK, FFTPACK subset of SLATEC
# removed from slatec/src to make the main source more accessible
# see also /netlib/fishpack, /netlib/fftpack

lib	slatec/fnlib
for	the FNLIB subset of SLATEC
# removed from slatec/src to make the main source more accessible
# see also /netlib/fn, which is another version;  we don't really
# know which one is more recent or bug-free.  If you figure it out
# please send email to ehg@research.bell-labs.com.

lib	slatec/pchip
for	piecewise cubic hermite approximation
# removed from slatec/src to make the main source more accessible
# see also /netlib/pchip

lib	slatec/test
for	54 quick check drivers
#  If some of the quick checks fail on certain machines, it
#  does not necessarily indicate a problem in the source, but
#  possibly in the quick checks themselves, or the machine
#  architecture or the operating system or the compiler or
#  vendor or user supplied software.
#  The main programs (quick check drivers) are test01.f,...,test54.f.
#  On the VAX under VMS, the quick checks should be run with
#  KPRINT = 0 or 1 (zero or one).
