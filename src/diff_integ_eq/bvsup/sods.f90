PURE SUBROUTINE SODS(A,X,B,Neq,Nuk,Nrda,Iflag,Work,Iwork)

  ! **Library:**   SLATEC

  ! **Type:**      SINGLE PRECISION (SODS-S)

  ! **Author:**  Watts, H. A., (SNLA)

  ! **Description:**
  !
  !     SODS solves the overdetermined system of linear equations A X = B,
  !     where A is NEQ by NUK and NEQ >= NUK. If rank A = NUK,
  !     X is the UNIQUE least squares solution vector. That is,
  !              R(1)**2 + ..... + R(NEQ)**2 = minimum
  !     where R is the residual vector  R = B - A X.
  !     If rank A < NUK, the least squares solution of minimal
  !     length can be provided.
  !     SODS is an interfacing routine which calls subroutine LSSODS
  !     for the solution. LSSODS in turn calls subroutine ORTHOL and
  !     possibly subroutine OHTROR for the decomposition of A by
  !     orthogonal transformations. In the process, ORTHOL calls upon
  !     subroutine CSCALE for scaling.

  !
  !     A -- Contains the matrix of NEQ equations in NUK unknowns and must
  !          be dimensioned NRDA by NUK. The original A is destroyed
  !     X -- Solution array of length at least NUK
  !     B -- Given constant vector of length NEQ, B is destroyed
  !     NEQ -- Number of equations, NEQ greater or equal to 1
  !     NUK -- Number of columns in the matrix (which is also the number
  !            of unknowns), NUK not larger than NEQ
  !     NRDA -- Row dimension of A, NRDA greater or equal to NEQ
  !     IFLAG -- Status indicator
  !            =0 For the first call (and for each new problem defined by
  !               a new matrix A) when the matrix data is treated as exact
  !           =-K For the first call (and for each new problem defined by
  !               a new matrix A) when the matrix data is assumed to be
  !               accurate to about K digits
  !            =1 For subsequent calls whenever the matrix A has already
  !               been decomposed (problems with new vectors B but
  !               same matrix a can be handled efficiently)
  !     WORK(*),IWORK(*) -- Arrays for storage of internal information,
  !                     WORK must be dimensioned at least  2 + 5*NUK
  !                     IWORK must be dimensioned at least NUK+2
  !     IWORK(2) -- Scaling indicator
  !                 =-1 If the matrix A is to be pre-scaled by
  !                 columns when appropriate
  !                 If the scaling indicator is not equal to -1
  !                 no scaling will be attempted
  !              For most problems scaling will probably not be necessary

  !
  !     IFLAG -- Status indicator
  !            =1 If solution was obtained
  !            =2 If improper input is detected
  !            =3 If rank of matrix is less than NUK
  !               If the minimal length least squares solution is
  !               desired, simply reset IFLAG=1 and call the code again
  !     X -- Least squares solution of  A X = B
  !     A -- Contains the strictly upper triangular part of the reduced
  !           matrix and the transformation information
  !     WORK(*),IWORK(*) -- Contains information needed on subsequent
  !                         Calls (IFLAG=1 case on input) which must not
  !                         be altered
  !                         WORK(1) contains the Euclidean norm of
  !                         the residual vector
  !                         WORK(2) contains the Euclidean norm of
  !                         the solution vector
  !                         IWORK(1) contains the numerically determined
  !                         rank of the matrix A
