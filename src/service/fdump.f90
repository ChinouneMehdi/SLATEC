  !
  !        ***Note*** Machine Dependent Routine
  !        FDUMP is intended to be replaced by a locally written
  !        version which produces a symbolic dump.  Failing this,
  !        it should be replaced by a version which prints the
  !        subprogram nesting list.  Note that this dump must be
  !        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the
  !        XGETUA routine.  See XSETUA and XGETUA for details.
